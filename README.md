# lumpy-skin-disease-prediction
This code uses machine learning to predict the presence of lumpy skin disease (a dreadful skin disease that can affect the entire body of cattle) based on geospatial data. The dataset was cleaned, and it has class imbalance, so it was appropriately resampled and was trained with an SVM.
